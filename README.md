## Description
Computer Applications is the way to converge computation with neuro., nano. quantum, bio, physics life energy and more. through simulation using computation and mathematical modeling . that's the motive of this Degree. because it's about science not engineering or not about service. it's about science of applied computing & applications of computer like computational neuroscience , computational physics etc. that is Bachelor's of Computer Applications ( BCA ) .
