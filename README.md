## **Current Focus**

I am currently completing the **applied computation** phase of my program — an intensive exploration of the **synergy between computer science and scientific engineering**, integrating software, hardware, and mathematical foundations.

My ongoing studies focus on:

* **Modeling and Simulation** — understanding how computational models represent physical, biological, or chemical phenomena.
* **Domain-Specific Computation** — applying algorithms to real-world systems such as neuroscience, drug discovery, and nanofabrication.
* **Hardware Optimization** — leveraging **CUDA**, **GPU acceleration**, and **high-performance computing (HPC)**,**JAX and TUNIX**  to scale computational simulations.

Following this, I intend to advance toward the **core computational modeling disciplines**, contributing to high-impact research at the intersection of **applied computation and scientific discovery**.
