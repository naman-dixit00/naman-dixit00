My research is guided by a philosophy: **AI should not only replicate intelligence but extend it—amplifying human potential while deepening our understanding of the mind itself.**


## Currently Learning 
* Currently I was focused on to complete my studies of applied computation part of Computer Applications that contains about the mixture of both science & engineering of computer ( Software and hardware mixed but both)
* and after completing this I'm moving towards the Core and main study of Computer applications ( the modeling and simulation and how to modeles the Applications of computer specific domains like neuroscience,  lithography, durg discovery in computation via mathematical modeling and which software is actually used to simulate this and hardware optimization like CUDA HPC etc.
