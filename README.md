## About Me

I am an undergraduate researcher passionate about bridging **neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science**. My work is motivated by a central question:
**How can computational models help us decode, replicate, and ultimately expand human cognition?**

* Leading projects at the intersection of **neuroscience, AI, and cognitive computation**.
* Focused on **computational modeling of brain function** to explore cognition, learning, and decision-making.
* Building a foundation that connects **theoretical neuroscience** with **applied machine learning**.

---

## Research Vision

* **Neuroscience × AI**: Harness computational frameworks to uncover principles of neural dynamics.
* **Modeling Cognition**: Develop models that simulate memory, perception, and learning processes.
* **Data-Driven Insights**: Apply large-scale data analysis to validate and refine brain-inspired models.

My broader aim is to advance the **next generation of AI systems** that are interpretable, adaptive, and grounded in cognitive science.

---

## Current Focus

* Computational frameworks for **neural representation and cognition**
* Machine learning approaches to **brain-inspired architectures**
* Exploring synergies between **biological intelligence and artificial systems**
* Initiating **cross-disciplinary research bridges** (linking neuroscience, philosophy of mind, and advanced AI).

---

## Technical Interests

* Computational Neuroscience
* Deep Learning & Representation Learning
* Reinforcement Learning & Decision Models
* Cognitive Modeling
* Data-Driven Neuroscience
* Neuromorphic Computing and Brain-Inspired Architectures
